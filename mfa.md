# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): An Extra Layer of Security

## What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

Imagine your password is like the key to your house. If a thief steals your key, they can walk right in. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is like adding a deadbolt that requires a secret code only you know. Even if the thief has your key (your password), they are stopped at the door because they don't have the second piece of the puzzle.

MFA adds at least one extra verification step to your login process to prove you are who you say you are.

## How it Works in Simple Terms

MFA requires you to provide two or more of the following types of credentials:

1.  **Something you know:** Typically your password.
2.  **Something you have:** A physical object like your smartphone (to receive a code) or a security key.
3.  **Something you are:** A unique physical trait like your fingerprint, face, or voice.

Because it's highly unlikely that a cybercriminal could steal both your password *and* gain access to your physical device or biometric data, MFA is one of the most effective ways to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts.

## The Microsoft Technology Involved

**Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication** is Microsoft's solution for adding this critical security layer. When you enable it, signing in becomes a two-step process. After entering your password, you might be asked to:

-   Approve a notification sent to the **Microsoft Authenticator app** on your smartphone.
-   Enter a one-time code generated by the app or sent via text message.
-   Answer a phone call.
-   Provide a biometric scan via **Windows Hello**.

This simple step provides a massive boost in security for both you and the organization.
